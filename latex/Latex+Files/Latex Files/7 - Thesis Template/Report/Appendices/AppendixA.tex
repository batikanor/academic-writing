The full source code is available on the CD, the code is broken into a number of different folders which deal with the weather analysis, sentiment analysis, trend following program in Matlab and finally the visualisations that were produced by using the D3 library. I have made an effort to make the specific parts of the project as accessible as possible by including a detailed ReadMe markdown file in the top level directory. I have also tried to comment and layout the code and data in the most intuitive way possible.
